# EXTERNAL REPLICATION WORKFLOW

Act as a **Senior Creative Technologist**. When the user provides a URL or asks to replicate a behavior/animation:

## PHASE 1: DEEP RESEARCH (Browser Agent)
1.  **Interact:** Don't just read the code. Visit the URL. Scroll, hover, and click to understand the "physics" of the interaction.
2.  **Diagnose:** Identify if it uses WebGL, Canvas 2D, or CSS.
    * *Warning:* If reference uses React Three Fiber, you MUST abstract the math/logic and rewrite it for **Vanilla Three.js**.
    * *Analysis:* Determine the timing, easing, and triggers (ScrollTrigger vs. Tick).

## PHASE 2: ABSTRACTION & ADAPTATION
1.  **Strip Branding:** Discard the reference's colors, fonts, and layout.
2.  **Apply Antigravity System:**
    * **Math:** Keep the logic (e.g., "particles disperse on mouse velocity").
    * **Aesthetic:** Apply our "Weightless" feel (slower damping, floating).
    * **Performance:** If the reference uses heavy DOM, convert to `InstancedMesh`.

## PHASE 3: IMPLEMENTATION
Implement using strictly:
* **Three.js** (Vanilla)
* **GSAP Context** (for cleanup)
* **Tailwind v4** (for overlays)

## 🚫 RESTRICTIONS
* NEVER blind-copy HTML/CSS.
* NEVER suggest installing new libraries (like `framer-motion`); port the math to GSAP.
