# ANTIGRAVITY DESIGN & STRUCTURE SYSTEM

## 1. INTRINSIC DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
We do not build "Responsive" sites; we build **Intrinsic** sites.
* **Fluidity:** Use `%`, `vw`, `vh`, `min()`, `max()`, and `clamp()` for sizing. Avoid fixed pixels.
* **Elasticity:** Typography scales with the viewport using `clamp()`.
* **Context:** Use **Container Queries** (`@container`) for components so they adapt to their wrapper, not the screen.
* **Layout:** Use **CSS Subgrid** to align nested elements to the main grid.

## 2. STRUCTURAL SEMANTICS
* **Tags:** Use `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>` explicitly.
* **Hierarchy:** `<h1>` is unique. Headings must follow logical order (h1 -> h2 -> h3).
* **Accessibility:** All interactive elements must have `aria-label` if no text is present.

## 3. MOTION TO MEANING
Animations are functional, not decorative.
* **Entrance:** Elements must not just "appear". They should float in or fade with a purpose.
* **Feedback:** Interactive elements must react to hover/focus (scale, glow).
* **Narrative:** Use GSAP ScrollTrigger to tell a story as the user descends.

## 4. CSS ARCHITECTURE (Tailwind v4)
* **Theme:** Define all colors and fonts in the `@theme` block in `style.css`.
* **Tokens:** Use semantic names (e.g., `--color-surface-floating`) instead of raw hex codes.
* **Dark Mode:** Built-in via "Critical Coding Approach" (media strategy).
